#  Battleships - built with SpriteKit

The core game is built API first with a core set of rules and a representation of the grid as a 100 element array. Each array element contains various properties, such as ship occupying the position, whether it has been destroyed, what its x and y coords are.

Methods exist to support strikes, determining whether the game has won and an AI to take turns against with varying levels of difficulty.
